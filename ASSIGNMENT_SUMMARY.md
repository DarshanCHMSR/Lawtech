## DELIVERABLES

### Template 1 - Trigonometry Problems (2 Solutions)

#### **Problem 1: Cosec B + Tan A**
**File**: `problem1_trigonometry.html`

**Question**: If BC - AC = 16 and AB = 8, find (Cosec B + Tan A)

**Solution Steps**:
- Given: BC - AC = 16, AB = 8
- Simplified: 17 - 15 = 2, and 17² - 15² = 8²
- Pythagorean Triplet: (8, 15, 17)
- Triangle sides: AB = 8 cm, BC = 16 cm, AC = 17 cm
- Cosec B = Hypotenuse/Perpendicular = 17/15
- Tan A = Perpendicular/Base = 15/8
- **Answer**: Cosec B + Tan A = 261/120

**Changes Made**:
- Updated all numeric values (8, 15, 17)
- Changed trigonometric functions from "Sec C + Cot A" to "Cosec B + Tan A"
- Updated formula boxes to reflect correct definitions
- Modified Pythagorean triplet explanation
- Updated final answer

#### **Problem 2: Sin B + Cos A**
**File**: `problem2_trigonometry.html`

**Question**: If BC + AC = 35 and AB = 12, find (Sin B + Cos A)

**Solution Steps**:
- Given: BC + AC = 35, AB = 12
- Simplified: 20 + 15 = 35, and 20² - 15² = 12.5²
- Pythagorean Triplet: (12, 16, 20)
- Triangle sides: AB = 12 cm, BC = 16 cm, AC = 20 cm
- Sin B = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse = 12/20
- Cos A = Base/Hypotenuse = 16/20
- **Answer**: Sin B + Cos A = 7/5

**Changes Made**:
- Updated all numeric values (12, 16, 20)
- Changed trigonometric functions from "Sec C + Cot A" to "Sin B + Cos A"
- Modified condition from "AC - BC = 1" to "BC + AC = 35"
- Updated formula boxes to reflect correct definitions
- Modified Pythagorean triplet explanation
- Updated final answer

### Template 2 - Compound Interest Problems (2 Solutions)

#### **Problem 1: Finding Rate of Interest (2 years)**
**File**: `problem1_compound_interest.html`

**Question**: A sum of ₹5000 amounts to ₹6050 in 2 years at compound interest. Find the rate of interest.

**Solution Steps**:
- Principal (P) = ₹5000
- Amount (A) = ₹6050
- Time (n) = 2 years
- Formula: A = P(1 + r/100)²
- 6050/5000 = (1 + r/100)²
- 121/100 = (1 + r/100)²
- 11/10 = 1 + r/100
- r = 1/10 × 100 = 10%
- **Answer**: Rate = 10%
- **Bonus**: Amount in 3 years = ₹6655

**Changes Made**:
- Changed principal from 12000 to 5000
- Changed amount from 20736 to 6050
- Changed time period from 3 years to 2 years
- Updated fraction simplification (121/100 instead of 216/125)
- Changed cube roots to square roots (11², 10² instead of 6³, 5³)
- Updated rate from 20% to 10%
- Updated bonus calculation for 3 years

#### **Problem 2: Finding Rate of Interest (3 years)**
**File**: `problem2_compound_interest.html`

**Question**: A sum of ₹8000 amounts to ₹9261 in 3 years at compound interest. Find the rate of interest.

**Solution Steps**:
- Principal (P) = ₹8000
- Amount (A) = ₹9261
- Time (n) = 3 years
- Formula: A = P(1 + r/100)³
- 9261/8000 = (1 + r/100)³
- 1331/1000 = (1 + r/100)³
- 11/10 = 1 + r/100
- r = 1/10 × 100 = 10%
- **Answer**: Rate = 10%
- **Bonus**: Amount in 2 years = ₹9680

**Changes Made**:
- Changed principal from 12000 to 8000
- Changed amount from 20736 to 9261
- Kept time period as 3 years
- Updated fraction simplification (1331/1000 instead of 216/125)
- Changed cube roots (11³, 10³ instead of 6³, 5³)
- Updated rate from 20% to 10%
- Changed bonus calculation from 3 years to 2 years
